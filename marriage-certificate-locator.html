    Information compiled from official state and county sources as of early 2026. Marriage records are frequently maintained at the county level (where the license was issued) rather than centrally at the state office. Fees and processing times are approximate and may vary depending on expedited service, search years, or county-specific rules. Always verify directly on the official website. Many states partner with <a href="https://www.vitalchek.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VitalChek</a> for expedited online orders.
